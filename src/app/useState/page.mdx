# Playing with useState in React

## 🏗️ The Basics of useState
This blog app lets people search and filter content using topic tags.
Right now the search doesn't work because we haven't hooked up the state management yet,
the UI isn't synced with what's being typed.
The interface is already built, but we need to implement the state hooks to track user input
and dynamically update the post list.
