Before you join our React workshop, make sure you're all set! Here's what you'll need:
- A non-LBG device 💻: While we don't expect any issues on LBG-dev Macs, it's recommended to use a non-LBG device for smoother performance.
- Node.js version > 18 🌱: Ensure you have Node.js version 18 or higher installed on your machine. You can download it from here.
- Git 🧑‍💻: You'll need Git for version control. If you don't have it installed, you can get it here.
- Terminal 🖥️: A command-line interface will be essential to run various development tasks.
- An IDE of your choice 🧑‍🔧: Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or WebStorm, but feel free to use whatever you're most comfortable with.
- Eagerness to Learn 🚀: The most important prerequisite! Come with an open mind and enthusiasm to explore React.

- React 101: We'll start with the basics—understanding React forms, managing inputs, handling error boundaries, and working with lists.
- React Hooks: Learn how to manage UI state, lift state between components, handle side effects, and optimise DOM effects using React hooks.
- Advanced Patterns: Dive into advanced React patterns like component composition, compound components, using slots, reducers, and initialisers to manage complex state and behavior.
- Suspense: Master React Suspense for efficient data fetching, dynamic promises, implementing optimistic UI, and using Suspense optimisations to enhance user experience.
